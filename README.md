maintain a simple class structure in redis across a socket connection

(April 2014) This project is still exploratory, as it is a spin-off from a private repository, but the code is usable, feel free to have a look around. Note that the web client currently has a dependency on https://github.com/jake-rigby/microbe at the back end.
